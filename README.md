# Grease Monkey Maintenance Tracker

## Description

"Grease Monkey" is an application where the user can quickly and easily add, reference, and maintain any and all car repairs and maintenance! Simply login, add your vehicle, and you're well on your way to stress-free car maintenance! 

The developers at Grease Monkey Co. know all too well the stresses of maintaining a modern vehicle. We're far too busy, and so are you! That's why we crafted the Grease Monkey Maintenance Tracker to be as easy and efficient to use as possible. Building the application granted us with further practice with Node, Express, MySql, and Handlebars technologies.
